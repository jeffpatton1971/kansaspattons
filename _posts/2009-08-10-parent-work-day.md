I had a jam packed weekend of fun let me tell you! Actually it wasn’t too bad and I did wind up getting some sun out of it!

Natalie starts Kindergarten August 24th and her school, Cair Paravel Latin School, had a parent work day. I got there around 10a with gloves, rakes, saws and all manner of tools as they said bring whatever you have. I wound up working a chainsaw cutting large branches into smaller ones. After that we loaded up all the bundles around the whole school onto a large trailer, it’s a good thing the forestry dump didn’t charge by the pound!

The hardest part of the whole day was unloading all the wood from that trailer. Mother nature surely knows how to make you feel like a wimp! But that was quickly followed by the coolest part where the kid running the dump used a bobcat to fill the trailer with mulch. He had that thing up on two wheels multiple times! I’ve never been so jealous in my life!

After I was done there I headed over to my sister-in-laws to help her dad work finishing the bathroom. This has been an ongoing project for a while. The story is really to lame to relate, needless to say her dad has been working on it for about a week doing what he can. So we installed all the wains coat in the bathroom and then I installed the tub surround.

Sunday I spent another day out in the heat, but this time working on my own yard. I think once we get a new house that I’m totally going to get a push mower with one of those rollers on the back. I would love my lawn to look like the outfield at Royal’s stadium! Then back to working on the bathroom, I cleaned up all the excess adhesive and caulk from around the surround. Sweated on the last of the copper and connected the tub faucet. I’m really only concerned about the draining, I’ve never installed a bathtub before, we had done that earlier in the week.

And as if the day wasn’t busy enough my Aunt and Uncle’s 30th wedding anniversary was last night. It was really nice no dinner but plenty of snacky type things to eat and some really awesome cake! Natalie had a blast playing with her newly acquired uncle Scott, the balloons were a big hit!
