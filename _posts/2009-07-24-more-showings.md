Well we’ve had several more showings over this past week, it’s been rather exciting! In fact including today’s showings, we’ve had 8 since Thursday! There have been a few comments that were less than exciting but one yesterday was very promising, I don’t know if they were interested enough to make an offer, but it sounds like our house was in their top 10 list!

I really need to get the pictures uploaded here…sigh
