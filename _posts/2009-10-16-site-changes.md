Nobody but me reads this..lol..but I changed the theme from the default Garland, to nitobe. I deleted several of the included header images, there were about 10 I took it down to 4. Each time the page loads it randomly picks a new image from the list. I should really go find some pictures and crop them into header imagesâ€¦
