Spent the entire day downstairs, got rid of all my old computer stuff. I took it to Extreme Recycling and I’m pretty sure they thought that all those computers could not have possibly come from one house! Sadly, they did, I filled an entire mini-van with computers and computer parts. I feel like I should be in CCA, Computer Collector’s Annonymous!

Between all the computers and parts was random junk that nobody would take. I wound up filling an entire mini-van full of trash. I took it to the dump…err…LAND FILL! the last bits of my office desk, two old kitchen chairs and about a dozen bags of junk. The land fill is way out on Hwy 75, close to whichever of the casino’s is closest to Topeka.

Natalie decided to come along, she wanted to go wherever daddy went! I don’t think it was nearly as interesting as she thought it would be, she also informed me that it was very stinky!

The basement is now clean, as far as basements go. There are shelves along the walls that we have all of our decorations and junk in. But you can now walk wherever you wan in the basement without worrying about what you might bump into. Turns out we finished none too soon, we had a showing at 415.

We’ve had about 20 showings in the two and a half weeks we’ve had the house on the market. The open house seems to have gone well, but we’ve not heard anything back yet so most likely nobody is too interested. Oh well, perhaps this will be the month that people will be more inclined to buy.

Crossing my fingers…
