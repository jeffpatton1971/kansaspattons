We decided to visit downtown Lawrence this year and it turns out that was a good decision. Lawrence has some fun people and entertaining people. We started on 9th street and walked down to Freestate Brewery then back up to 9th. It took an hour and in that amount of time Natalie had almost a full bucket of candy! In addition to all the people dressed up, there were also some dogs dressed up!

After visiting Mass. St. we headed over to the nursing home off Wakarusa. We started going there last year I believe and Natalie enjoyed it a great deal, as did the elderly. From there we had dinner at Applebeeâ€™s with grandpa and headed home.

Enjoy the pictures!
