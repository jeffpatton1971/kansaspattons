Ok, so today I was supposed to work on my house to get ready for the open house tomorrow. Wound up spending all day working over at Malia’s sisters house. The upside is at least I will now be able to install a bahtub, one of the things I never needed to do at this house. The bad thing is, I will NEVER install a bathtub as I’m pretty sure our next house will be done when we move in!

Sigh…what a day!
