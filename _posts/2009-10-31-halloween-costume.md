This year for Halloween Natalie’s choice of costumes ranged far and wide, but they always included wings! Malia and I worked the night before making wings out of wire, and Malia woke up yesterday morning quite early and began putting the fabric on the wings. I ran to the dollar store and bought out all of the white feather boa’s that they had.

Natalie then went Trick-or-Treating at [TARC](http://www.tarcinc.org/) like she does every year.
