If only every day could start out like this. Woke up around 7a, Malia went off to work at 730 and I made a pot of coffee. By 8a I was relaxing on the back porch listening to the wind in the trees, sipping my coffee and enjoying the cool breeze. Everything was serene and peacful, and that’s when it happened!

All of a sudden I realized that today is Thursday, and that I had only one day left of vacation until I had to go back to work! I won’t deny that I teared up, just a little.

It’s actually been a very productive vacation, and the best part is that I have gotten to spend some time with my daughter before school starts. Most schools around here start on the 17th, but Natalie’s school starts on the 24th, Malia’s birthday. I’ll be taking that day off as well, mainly because Malia will most likely be a wreck.

Well, it’s been fun but sadly there is some work yet to be done, maybe tomorrow Natalie and I will do something fun!
